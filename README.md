# HTA-Printer-Driver
A HTA web app that downloads and installs AD printer drivers. Written as a single file coded with HTML5 and VBS. The HTA installs domain PaperCut print queues on a non domain computer. Using Htaedit we compile the final HTA file into an exe for ease of use, although the HTA file is all that is required.
